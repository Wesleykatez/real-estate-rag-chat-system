# üöÄ **NEW FEATURES: Dubai Real Estate RAG System**

## **üìã Overview**

This document outlines the two major new features implemented for the Dubai Real Estate RAG Chat System:

1. **Proactive "Deal-Flow" Agent** - Daily automated briefings
2. **Hyper-Personalized Content Generation Co-Pilot** - AI-powered content creation

---

## **üéØ Feature 1: Proactive "Deal-Flow" Agent**

### **What It Does**
Automatically generates personalized daily briefings for real estate agents at 7:00 AM Dubai time, providing actionable insights on:
- **Stale Leads**: Clients not contacted in 3+ days
- **Recent Viewings**: Yesterday's viewings requiring follow-up
- **Today's Meetings**: Scheduled appointments and preparation tips

### **How It Works**
1. **Scheduled Execution**: Runs daily at 7:00 AM (Asia/Dubai timezone)
2. **Data Collection**: Queries database for agent-specific information
3. **AI Generation**: Uses Google Gemini to create personalized briefings
4. **Storage**: Saves briefings as messages in agent's primary conversation thread

### **Database Tables Added**
```sql
-- Leads table for tracking client interactions
CREATE TABLE leads (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    agent_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(255),
    phone VARCHAR(50),
    status VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'new',
    last_contacted TIMESTAMP,
    notes TEXT
);

-- Viewings table for property viewings
CREATE TABLE viewings (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    agent_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
    client_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    property_address TEXT NOT NULL,
    viewing_date DATE NOT NULL,
    client_feedback TEXT,
    follow_up_required BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE
);

-- Appointments table for scheduled meetings
CREATE TABLE appointments (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    agent_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
    client_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    appointment_date DATE NOT NULL,
    appointment_time TIME NOT NULL,
    appointment_type VARCHAR(100),
    notes TEXT
);
```

### **Sample Data Included**
- **4 leads** with different statuses and contact histories
- **3 viewings** with client feedback
- **4 appointments** scheduled for today

### **API Endpoints**
- `POST /admin/trigger-daily-briefing` - Manually trigger briefing generation (for testing)

---

## **üéØ Feature 2: Hyper-Personalized Content Generation Co-Pilot**

### **What It Does**
Recognizes specific commands in chat and generates personalized content:
- **Instagram Posts**: Property-specific social media content
- **Follow-up Emails**: Personalized client communication
- **WhatsApp Broadcasts**: Mass messaging for client updates

### **Command Recognition**
The system recognizes these command patterns:

| Command | Intent | Example |
|---------|--------|---------|
| `/create post` | `create_instagram_post` | `/create post for property #1 targeting young professionals` |
| `/draft email` | `draft_follow_up_email` | `/draft email for client Sarah Johnson` |
| `/generate whatsapp` | `generate_whatsapp_broadcast` | `/generate whatsapp for all clients about new listings` |

### **How It Works**
1. **Intent Detection**: Uses regex patterns and NLP to identify commands
2. **Parameter Extraction**: Parses property IDs, client names, target audiences
3. **Data Retrieval**: Fetches relevant property and client information
4. **Content Generation**: Uses Google Gemini to create personalized content
5. **Response Delivery**: Returns formatted content ready for use

### **Content Types Generated**

#### **Instagram Posts**
- **Property Details**: Address, price, bedrooms, bathrooms, description
- **Target Audience**: Customized messaging for specific demographics
- **Hashtags**: Dubai real estate specific tags
- **Call-to-Action**: Compelling next steps

#### **Follow-up Emails**
- **Client Personalization**: Name, budget, preferences, notes
- **Property Context**: Specific property details if mentioned
- **Professional Tone**: Agent-appropriate communication style
- **Clear CTA**: Specific next steps

#### **WhatsApp Broadcasts**
- **Audience Targeting**: All clients, specific segments, or custom groups

Response:
Subject: Follow-up: Marina Gate Property Viewing

Dear Sarah,

I hope this email finds you well! I wanted to follow up on our viewing of the Marina Gate 1 apartment yesterday.

I know you loved the marina views and the overall layout of the property. Regarding your concern about service charges, I'd be happy to provide a detailed breakdown and discuss how this compares to similar properties in the area.

Given your budget of AED 2-3.5M and preference for 2-3 bedroom apartments with marina views, I have a few other properties that might interest you:

‚Ä¢ A 3-bedroom apartment in Marina Gate 2 with similar views
‚Ä¢ A 2-bedroom corner unit in Marina Heights with larger balcony
‚Ä¢ A 3-bedroom apartment in Marina Promenade with better service charge rates

Would you be available for a quick call this week to discuss these options and address your service charge concerns?

Best regards,
[Agent Name]
[Phone Number]
[Email]
